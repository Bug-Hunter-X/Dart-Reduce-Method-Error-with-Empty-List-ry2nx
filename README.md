# Dart Reduce Method Error with Empty List

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `reduce` method on an empty list in Dart. The `reduce` method requires at least one element to perform the reduction; otherwise, it throws an error.

The `bug.dart` file contains code that reproduces this error. The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a solution using a check for an empty list.
